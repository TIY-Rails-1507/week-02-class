# write code that creates a new account with an opening balance of 100
# keep asking the user if they want to exit or withdraw
# if they want to withdraw, ask how much
# try to withdraw however much they asked for
# if the account allows the user to withdraw, then show the new balance and ask if they want to exit or withdraw again (i.e go back to line 2)
# if they try to go over their balance, the account class will throw an exception
# rescue the exception and show an error message
# then ask if they want to exit or withdraw again (i.e go back to line 2)
